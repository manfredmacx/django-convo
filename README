============
Django convo
============

A Django app to create a threaded forum.

Key features:
A logged in user can edit posts they create or children of posts they create.  That is, a user has limited mod privileges in their own threads.

A logged in user can also edit any post by an anonymous user.

If the Django user's email is connected to a Gravatar account, that icon will be used to identify the user.  If not, a random default Gravatar icon will be used.  Free accounts available at http://www.gravatar.com

Dependencies:
Django-wysiwyg - WYSIWYG editor for creating and editing entries  (http://github.com/pydanny/django-wysiwyg)
Bleach - HTML sanitizer for cleaning user-submitted content (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bleach)
