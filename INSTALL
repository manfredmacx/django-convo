Thanks for downloading Django-convo

To install, run the following command inside this directory:

    python setup.py install

Or if you'd prefer, you can simply place the included ``convo`` directory
somewhere on your PYTHONPATH, or symlink to it from somewhere on your
PYTHONPATH; this is useful if you're working from a Git checkout.

Note that this application was developed using Django 1.1 and Python 2.6.  It may work with other versions, but has not been tested.
You can obtain Python from http://www.python.org/ and Django from http://www.djangoproject.com/.
