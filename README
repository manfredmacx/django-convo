============
Django convo
============

A Django app to create a threaded forum.

Key features:
A logged in user can edit their own post, as well as any post in a thread they create.  This means that each user, upon registering, can have mod privileges on their own threads.  The intent is to allow the community to self-moderate.

A logged in user can also edit any post by an anonymous user.

If the Django user's email is connected to a Gravatar account, that icon will be used to identify the user.  If not, a random default Gravatar icon will be used.  Free accounts available at http://www.gravatar.com

Dependencies:
Django-wysiwyg - WYSIWYG editor for creating and editing entries  (http://github.com/pydanny/django-wysiwyg)
Bleach - HTML sanitizer for cleaning user-submitted content (http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bleach)

This app is live and in production at http://www.manfredmacx.com/social/
